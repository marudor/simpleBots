simpleBots
==========

My second try to develop a Interface for automatic Generation of accounts on several Platforms (Currently Twitter only)
This time with a Web Interface using JAX-WS

##usage


Set Twitter Developer Tokens using any account in twitter4j.properties  
Set login to an EmailAccount getting all the Emails from twitter in simpleBots.properties  
Set a Email template that is used to regiter Accounts in simpleBots.properties  
Set a publish URL in jaxws.properties
set Database information in hibernate.properties

Now just compile, start, have fun doing stuff with Bots!


##Notes
Please use this responsible!
You can - in theory do dangerous stuff with this.
I "kinda" annoyed of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia when they used a TwitterWall on a public Event with my old Version.  
But well - at least they had Cats.
